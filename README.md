# Recipe Manager â†’ Name TBD

An app to let you track recipes, weekly ideas, and other data about your recipes. The goal is to help make meal planning/picking from available meals easier. Also want to add things like push notifications to help you remember to check the day's recipes, and a stop watch/timer so you can find out how long it actually takes you to make the recipes since "time to cook" != how long it actually takes for most of us.
